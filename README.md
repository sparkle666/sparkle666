### My Projects

Declutta is a marketplace platform that connects people who want to declutter their homes with buyers looking for secondhand items. Users can list items for sale or giveaway, chat with potential buyers, manage wishlists, and complete secure transactions through Paystack integration.

I architected and built the complete backend infrastructure using AdonisJS and TypeScript, focusing on payment security, data integrity, and developer experience.
